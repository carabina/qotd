# QOTD

An example app using SwiftUI, WeeDux and SwifTEA.

## Overview

SwiftUI gives us the opportunity to exploit unidirectional data flow within iOS and related platforms. This this application shows how to use [WeeDux](https://github.com/weegigs/weedux) to drive SwiftUI and explores the ergonomics of the solution.

## Todo

- [X] Creating a `Program` and `Model` with persistence support
- [X] Service Access
- [X] Remote Images with stateless components
- [ ] Cancelling Background Tasks
